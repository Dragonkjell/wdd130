    <h2>Packer Wittwer</h2>

    <p>Hey I'm Packer. I'm from Shelley, ID, which is about 45 minutes from Rexburg. I've been married about 8-9 months, and we don't have any kids yet. I have a ton of things I love to do, including the piano, violin, 3d printing, video games, and off-roading.</p>

    <p>I'm currently in the Computer Engineering Program, but I will be switching to Computer Science. I love computers and would love to be able to work on them for my career. I think hardware and software are both really cool. I'm thinking of doing a masters degree in Computer Science, Cybersecurity, or something similar. I think getting a good base in web design would help me be more flexible in a career.</p>
